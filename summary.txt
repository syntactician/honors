My project is to create curricula to introduce Secondary English students to
debate and train Secondary English educators to run and judge those debates
fairly. In high school, I competed in Lincoln-Douglas, Public Form and Policy
debate events. Debate taught me about topics from transportation infrastructure
to literary theory, but more importantly, it taught me how to reason, how to
research, and how to listen to various points of view. I think that this is
debate's strength: it pushes students not to memorize and regurgitate, but
rather to form, articulate, and defend their own positions. It celebrates
students' own thoughts, arguments, and styles. This positions debate to empower
a wide variety of students to learn and to grow into informed, active citizens.
Unfortunately, debate is not always judged fairly. Often, judges undervalue the
language and argumentation of debaters of color. I think that this often has
less to do with intentional discrimination than with lack of training. I intend
to create a curriculum to train educators to facilitate debate fairly,
respecting variety in language and in argumentation. I hope that this project
will make debate more available and more empowering for a diverse population of
students.
